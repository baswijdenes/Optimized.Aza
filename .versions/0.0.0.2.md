# Connect-Aza
With Connect-Aza you can now also connect to different API's. 
For example Azure Storage:
'https://storage.azure.com/.default'

Due to this, I also added an option to Put, Post, and Patch cmdlets to include a customheader. 

In the backend the customheader will be added to the main header and reverted back after the command has run.

# Get-Aza
Added support for XML responses. 

With $global:AzaDataType you can see different returned properties: PSCustomObject, XML, JSON, and original content.

# Put-Aza
New cmdlet. It uses Post-Aza with Parameter -put switch.
